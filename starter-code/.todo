Iteration 4 | Today's Foods List

Create a button on each item. When a user clicks the button it should be added to a list of foods which are "today's foods".

Somewhere on the page, display a list of today's foods, with a total calorie count.

Bonus | Quantities

In addition to the "Add to today's list" button, create an input for quanitity. Whenever a user enters a quanitity into the input, you should add that many of the item to their list.

The default quanitity should be 1.

Super Bonus

If the user has added more than 1 item of the same type to their list, don't add it twice. Instead, display the item's name, and the number of times it has been added.

For instance:

Banana x2
Salmon x5
Cake
