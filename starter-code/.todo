Iteration 3 | Add New Foods

Create a button to add new foods.

When a user clicks the button, a form will appear with fields for a name, calories, and image.

When the user clicks submit, the food will be added to the new food list.

When the user clicks the submit button, or when they click add food again the form should disappear.

Iteration 4 | Today's Foods List

Create a button on each item. When a user clicks the button it should be added to a list of foods which are "today's foods".

Somewhere on the page, display a list of today's foods, with a total calorie count.

Bonus | Quantities

In addition to the "Add to today's list" button, create an input for quanitity. Whenever a user enters a quanitity into the input, you should add that many of the item to their list.

The default quanitity should be 1.

Super Bonus

If the user has added more than 1 item of the same type to their list, don't add it twice. Instead, display the item's name, and the number of times it has been added.

For instance:

Banana x2
Salmon x5
Cake
